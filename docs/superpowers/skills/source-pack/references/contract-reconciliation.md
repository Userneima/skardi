# Phase 1 — Live contract reconciliation

The provider's public API docs describe the provider. Skardi talks to
**Open Connector**, whose action contracts rename keys (camelCase),
reject unknown inputs (`additionalProperties: false`), sometimes rebuild
rows entirely, and consume provider error envelopes. Everything below is
about observing the real gateway instead of assuming.

## 1. Start a local gateway

Look for a local checkout of
[oomol-lab/open-connector](https://github.com/oomol-lab/open-connector)
(historically `~/Workspace/open-connector`); clone it if absent. Then:

```bash
cd <open-connector-checkout>
npm install          # once
OOMOL_CONNECT_DATA_DIR=/tmp/oc-data \
OOMOL_CONNECT_RUNTIME_TOKEN=skardi-live-test-token \
PORT=3000 npm run start
```

Health check (the runtime token is required once configured):

```bash
curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer skardi-live-test-token' \
  http://localhost:3000/v1/health
```

Run the server in the background and remember to stop it when done.

## 2. Know the real HTTP surface (verified v1.3.1)

These facts cost a full client rewrite to learn; do not regress them:

- Every `/v1` response uses the uniform envelope
  `{"success": bool, "message": str, "data": …, "meta": {…}}` (+
  `errorCode` on failures; `meta.executionId` once execution started).
- Execute is `POST /v1/actions/:actionId` — there is **no** `/execute`
  suffix. Success payload is under `data`.
- Discovery is `GET /v1/actions/:actionId` — `data.inputSchema`,
  `data.outputSchema`, `data.execution.locallyExecutable`,
  `data.execution.noAuthRunnable` (all camelCase, `execution` nested).
- The connection-alias header is `x-oo-connector-alias` (or
  `x-oomol-connector-alias`; `?alias=` also works).
- There is **no read/write classification** in action metadata — the
  raw-scan gate (`open_connector_scan`) refuses by default-deny against
  today's gateway. Pack tables are unaffected (read-only by Skardi's
  review).
- Input schema validation runs BEFORE any credential is used, which
  enables the no-credential trick below — with the default-connection
  caveat explained there.

Skardi's client (`open_connector/client.rs`) and `testutil.rs` mocks
already speak this protocol; if the live gateway ever disagrees with
them, that is a finding to fix in the client, not to absorb in the pack.

## 3. Probe the provider's actions

```bash
TOK='Authorization: Bearer skardi-live-test-token'
# What exists — never assume an action ID:
curl -s -H "$TOK" "http://localhost:3000/v1/actions?service=<provider>"
# Per-action contract:
curl -s -H "$TOK" "http://localhost:3000/v1/actions/<provider>.<action>"
# Human-readable guide (input examples, scopes, connection identity):
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/actions/<provider>.<action>/agent.md
```

For each candidate action record: exact ID, `inputSchema` properties +
`required` + `additionalProperties`, `outputSchema` top-level keys (row
array key = your row path), pagination inputs (`perPage`/`page`?
`cursor`/`limit`?), and `execution.requiredAuthTypes`.

## 4. Read the executor source — the row-shape authority

`<open-connector-checkout>/src/providers/<service>/` contains the
executors. This is the only reliable answer to:

- **Passthrough vs normalized rows.** GitHub's executors return the
  provider's raw objects (so fields the declared schema omits — e.g.
  `updated_at` — still arrive, because `additionalProperties: true`).
  Slack's executors REBUILD rows (camelCase keys, flattened profiles,
  renamed row arrays, cursor moved to top-level `nextCursor`). Mapping
  Slack's raw field names would have produced all-NULL columns that no
  provider doc would explain.
- **In-band provider errors.** If the executor raises on the provider's
  in-band error (Slack's `assertSlackPayload` throws on `ok: false`),
  the gateway returns a failure envelope and the pack declares
  `error_path: None`. Only a gateway that FORWARDS in-band errors needs
  `error_path` (the engine checks it before row extraction; the mock
  pack models it).
- **Which inputs actually reach the provider** and under what names —
  the executor's `compactObject({...})` mapping is the ground truth for
  filter pushdown fidelity.
- **Emitted output construction** — where the row array, totals, and
  cursors really live.
- **Pagination soundness** — specifically whether the executor filters
  rows AFTER paginating (`.filter(...)` on the fetched page). If it does,
  the filtered page length carries no termination information and NO
  pack-side termination rule is sound (a short page may be mid-collection;
  an all-filtered page is empty but non-final). Check whether the
  response carries a raw-length or total signal (`pageInfo.fetched`,
  `paging.pages`) and declare it; if the gateway destroys the signal
  entirely, the fix belongs UPSTREAM — contribute it (precedent:
  oomol-lab/open-connector#228 added `pageInfo.fetched` to
  `list_repository_issues`) or defer the table per the admission gate.
  Never ship a table whose termination is known-unsound.

## 5. Validate generated inputs without provider credentials

Schema validation fires before any credential is used, so a wrong key is
distinguishable from a missing login. Why this works (verified in source
AND live, v1.3.1): for the **default** connection,
`connection-service.ts#resolveForExecution` does not throw when nothing
is configured — it returns a connection whose credential resolves lazily
— so the runner reaches `core/execution.ts#executeAction`, whose first
step is `validateActionInput`. Invalid input → `invalid_input` before
credentials exist; valid input → the executor runs, asks for the
credential, and `provider-runtime.ts` raises "Configure <service>
credentials first."

```bash
# Wrong key → HTTP 400, errorCode invalid_input, names the bad property:
curl -s -X POST -H "$TOK" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{"owner":"a","repo":"b","per_page":5}}' \
  http://localhost:3000/v1/actions/github.list_repository_issues
# Correct keys, no connection → HTTP 403, "Configure … credentials first.":
curl -s -X POST -H "$TOK" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{"owner":"a","repo":"b","perPage":5}}' \
  http://localhost:3000/v1/actions/github.list_repository_issues
```

Preconditions for the discrimination to be valid:

- **Probe the default connection only** — no `x-oo-connector-alias`
  header, no `?alias=`, no `connectionName`. A NAMED connection that
  does not exist fails as `connection_not_found` BEFORE validation, so
  valid and invalid inputs become indistinguishable.
- **No action policy blocking the action**
  (`OOMOL_CONNECT_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` / `OOMOL_CONNECT_BLOCKED_ACTIONS`) —
  policy denials also precede validation.
- **Calibrate once per session**: send one known-bad key and one
  known-good input first and confirm you get the two DIFFERENT responses
  (400 `invalid_input` naming the property vs 403
  `authorization_failed`). If both come back identical, stop and find
  out why instead of treating either as schema evidence.

Reaching the credential wall then proves the pack's generated inputs
(pagination params, fixed inputs, filter keys, resource keys) pass the
strict schema. Do this for every table's input set. Row-data validation
additionally needs a configured connection
(`PUT /api/connections/<service>` with `{authType, values}` — ask the
user; never handle their credentials yourself) and provider egress
(note: fake-IP DNS environments block egress at the gateway's SSRF guard;
contract-level validation above needs neither).

## 6. Capture the contracts for fingerprint pinning

For each chosen action, save `data.outputSchema` verbatim as a fixture:

```
crates/skardi/src/sources/providers/open_connector/packs/fixtures/<provider>/contracts/<action_name>.json
```

Phase 3 pins each table's `expected_fingerprint` to the BLAKE3 hash of
the canonicalized schema (computed by
`action_registry::fingerprint_schema` — never re-derive the
canonicalization elsewhere) and locks pin ↔ fixture with a sync test.
Record the gateway version you captured against.

**The captured contract is fingerprint input, not column truth.** For
passthrough executors the declared output schema can under-declare
fields the wire carries, misname them (Notion declared `archived`;
the wire spells `is_archived`), or hide them in `anyOf` branches the
coverage walker does not descend — and a mis-declared column in that
gap maps to an always-NULL column with no error at registration OR
scan time. Design tables from the contract in phase 2, but treat every
passthrough column set as provisional until phase 4's real rows
confirm it. Also note which columns the coverage-gap pin reports as
outside the fingerprint gate: those are exactly the ones only real
data can verify.
