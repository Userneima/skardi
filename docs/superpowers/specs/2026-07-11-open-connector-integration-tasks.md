# Tasks: Open Connector Integration

Design spec: [2026-07-11-open-connector-integration-design.md](./2026-07-11-open-connector-integration-design.md)

This file tracks the implementation of the Open Connector integration as a
series of independently reviewable milestones. Each milestone is one PR.
The integration cannot land in a single PR; this document is the map that
lets reviewers see where any given PR fits in the whole.

Legend: `[x]` done and merged/in PR · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` not started

---

## Milestone 1 — Typed-config foundation (PR: feature/open-connector-foundation)

The config layer every later piece builds on. No network I/O, nothing
registered.

- [x] 1.1 `DataSourceType::OpenConnector` with explicit serde rename (`open_connector`)
- [x] 1.2 `OpenConnectorConfig` / `OpenConnectorBinding` matching the design-spec YAML (`runtime_token_env`, timeouts, `max_pages`/`max_rows`, `cache_max_bytes`, `cache_ttl_seconds`, `raw_action_allowlist`, `bindings`), with `deny_unknown_fields` so a misspelled key (e.g. `source_pack_versions`) fails loudly instead of silently disabling the pin
- [x] 1.3 Optional `source_pack_version` pin on bindings (schema stability across Skardi upgrades)
- [x] 1.4 `OpenConnectorError` with pre-network validation variants
- [x] 1.5 `OpenConnectorConfig::validate()` — pure, shared by server validation and provider registration (CLI/server parity); server `validate_data_sources` also rejects non-catalog hierarchy at config load (`OpenConnectorHierarchyRequired`) so a minimal config fails cleanly instead of aborting boot with a wrapped provider error
- [x] 1.6 Server wiring: `DataSource.open_connector` (required for that type, rejected elsewhere), `validate_data_sources`, registration dispatch, `/data_source` + dashboard type mapping; `OpenConnector` is in `CATALOG_SUPPORTED_SOURCES` so the catalog-mode guards (no `table`/`schema` options, no empty `allowed_schemas`) fire for it exactly as for postgres/dynamodb
- [x] 1.7 CLI wiring: same typed field and registration arm
- [x] 1.8 Read-only by construction, enforced at the single shared point: `register_open_connector_tables` takes `read_write` and rejects it (`ReadWriteNotSupported`), so server **and** CLI apply the invariant identically (server additionally keeps its typed `UnsupportedWriteMode` at config validation); job destinations rejected as non-transactional
- [x] 1.9 `register_open_connector_tables` entry point (validate → fail `ExecutionNotImplemented`)

**Verification**: 19 skardi + 7 skardi-server + 4 skardi-cli tests; all failure
modes asserted to fire before any network call.

## Milestone 2 — HTTP client + action registry (PR: feature/open-connector-foundation)

Everything network-facing, behind one client; planning-time metadata in memory.

- [x] 2.1 `OpenConnectorClient`: health / discover / execute against the `/v1` contract, endpoint paths centralized in private constants; action IDs validated at the client boundary (`InvalidActionId` — bare `.`/`..` and `/` rejected before any request, so IDs can't escape `/v1/actions/` through `Url::join` dot-segment resolution)
- [x] 2.2 Runtime token from env var as Bearer header, trimmed and validated at client construction (`InvalidRuntimeToken` for control characters / empty-after-trim — the `export TOKEN="$(cat token.txt)"` newline case fails fast instead of three retried "builder error"s; unbuildable requests are terminal via `RequestBuildFailed`); `http(s)` URLs only, with embedded credentials **and** query/fragment rejected (`GatewayUrlWithQueryOrFragment` — a `?token=…` query would leak into logs, `Debug`, and the data-sources API); token excluded from `Debug`
- [x] 2.3 Bounded retries split by idempotency: GET health/discovery retry 429 / transient 5xx / transport errors (exponential backoff + jitter, `Retry-After` honored and capped); POST execute retries **only** a pre-execution 429 — 5xx is terminal and transport failure raises `NonIdempotentAmbiguousFailure`, so a possibly-executed action is never re-sent
- [x] 2.4 Bounded response decoding enforced on declared `Content-Length` + streamed bytes; per-request timeout from config; `max_response_bytes` / `max_attempts` are operator-tunable `OpenConnectorConfig` fields (wired in `from_config`, zero rejected as `ZeroSafetyBound`); terminal error paths read a 4 KiB snippet instead of buffering a worst-case error page; execute serializes a borrowing envelope (no input deep-clone)
- [x] 2.5 Connection-alias header on execute calls; `execute()` is `pub(crate)` so the registry/UDTF allowlist gating is structurally un-bypassable from outside the crate (discovery and health stay public metadata); the execute envelope is strict — an object without `output` is `InvalidGatewayResponse` (error/async envelopes never flow downstream as action output), a non-object body is returned whole, and `map.remove` avoids cloning the envelope
- [x] 2.6 `ActionRegistry`: deduplicated, concurrency-bounded discovery of `raw_action_allowlist`; non-locally-executable actions rejected; missing executability flag rejected as `ActionExecutabilityUnknown` (default-deny, `Option<bool>` so "not declared" is never read as "executable"); no partial registry
- [x] 2.7 Compatibility fingerprint per action (canonicalized output schema → collision-resistant BLAKE3)
- [x] 2.8 Initial registration flow: validate → client → health → registry; milestone 3 replaces the temporary `ExecutionNotImplemented` result with catalog construction
- [x] 2.9 `reqwest` becomes a hard dependency of `skardi`; `remote-embed`/`llm-extract` features only gate UDF code
- [x] 2.10 Hand-rolled mock gateway (`testutil.rs`) — no mock-HTTP crate added

**Verification**: 43 skardi tests (client retry/terminal/bounding paths, registry
dedup/reject/fingerprint, registration stage ordering); local integration run
against a Python stub gateway (healthy path reaches `ExecutionNotImplemented`
after health + discovery; down gateway exhausts retries; missing token, invalid
config, unknown action all fail with targeted errors).

## Milestone 3 — Source packs + scan engine (done, same branch)

The relational core: stable table definitions → Arrow RecordBatches.

- [x] 3.1 `source_pack.rs` / `source_pack_registry.rs`: built-in `SourcePackTable` definitions (stable ID, action ID, row path, Arrow schema, pagination strategy, filter mappings, resource requirements, safety bounds, expected fingerprint), version pins enforced at binding time
- [x] 3.2 `row_path.rs`: JSON row extraction (`$.a.b` object-key paths) with page-scoped errors (`RowPathNotFound` / `RowPathNotArray` carry page + segment, never values)
- [x] 3.3 `json_to_arrow.rs`: fixed-schema conversion — missing required keys/type mismatches fail with (column, page, row, expected, found-kind); nullable → null; RFC 3339/epoch timestamps; `List<Utf8>`; opaque JSON fallback; extra upstream fields ignored
- [x] 3.4 `pagination.rs`: typed strategies (page-number with short/empty-page termination, cursor with `PaginationLoop` repeated-cursor detection); offset/next-link/has-more slot into the same enum when packs need them
- [x] 3.5 `filters.rs`: allowlisted Exact/Unsupported translation — **one operator per `FilterMapping`** by construction (a single `(input_field, literal)` pair can only faithfully represent one operator; `>=` is deliberately *not* mapped to the mock's strictly-greater `min_value`, so the boundary row can never be silently dropped), literal-side normalization, scalar→JSON conversion; `Inexact` reserved for conservative mappings
- [x] 3.6 `cache.rs`: bounded TTL `ScanCache` (canonical keys via shared `util::json::canonical_json`, LRU + byte budget + entry cap; `cache_ttl_seconds: 0` = live reads). Key includes gateway, alias, action, pack version, resource, translated filters, projection, **LIMIT**, and Arrow-schema fingerprint. Documented boundary: completed scans only — overlapping scans (self-join sides) are not deduplicated
- [x] 3.7 `exec.rs`: `OpenConnectorExec` — sequential pages via `try_unfold` (drop = cancel), per-page conversion, LIMIT early stop/truncation, `ScanBoundsExceeded` on max_pages/max_rows (incomplete ≠ success), `ScanTimeout`
- [x] 3.8 `table.rs`: `OpenConnectorTableProvider` — read-only (`TableType::Base`, no `insert_into`), `supports_filters_pushdown` shares the scan's allowlist
- [x] 3.9 Synthetic **mock source pack** (`packs/mock.rs`): `mock.items` with page-number pagination (per_page=2), one Exact filter (`value >` → `min_value`), `workspace` resource
- [x] 3.10 Registration builds the real catalog: bindings → pack resolution → discovery (allowlist + pack actions) → fingerprint gate → `MemoryCatalogProvider` (`<gateway>.<binding>.<table>`); `ExecutionNotImplemented` is gone — the catalog is queryable

**Verification**: 110 open_connector tests (all prior suites plus: multi-page
scan through SQL, Exact filter pushdown verified in gateway request bodies,
LIMIT early stop at one live page, cache replay with zero new requests,
self-join identical-key/concurrent-fetch documentation test, zero-bound and
traversal config rejections). CLI integration against a local Python stub
gateway: full scan pagination, `min_value` pushdown, LIMIT, federated JOIN
with a local CSV — all confirmed end to end.

## Milestone 4 — UDTFs + security/observability (follow-up PR)

The interactive SQL surface for the mock pack. **No SQL DDL**: the approved
design registers stable tables exclusively through context YAML
("registration is a configuration action, not a SQL action"), keeping the
SQL validator's no-DDL invariant and shared-`SessionContext` semantics
intact. `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... STORED AS OPEN_CONNECTOR` is a
documented future extension only, gated on a DDL authorization design —
do not reintroduce it here.

- [x] 4.1 `open_connector_query` UDTF (built-in pack definitions only): compiles into the same
      provider/scan/cache path as the YAML-bound table (identical schema, filter allowlist,
      fingerprint gate, shared per-gateway cache); plans against registration-time discovery,
      so an undiscovered action is a targeted planning error, never a hidden gateway call
- [x] 4.2 `open_connector_scan` UDTF (allowlisted raw actions only): deterministic row type
      derived from the discovered output schema at the row path (primitives typed,
      `["T","null"]` unions nullable, everything else opaque JSON) or a planning error
      recommending a source pack; single-page live execution (`PaginationStrategy::SinglePage`,
      no cache, no filter pushdown)
- [x] 4.3 Security policy enforcement: raw actions require allowlist membership **and** an
      explicit `read_only: true` in discovered metadata (mutating and unclassified actions
      rejected at planning, pre-HTTP, with distinct errors); YAML overrides of pack
      action/row_path/pagination/columns rejected by `deny_unknown_fields` (tests pin it);
      default-deny allowlist unchanged
- [x] 4.4 Observability: scan completion/failure tracing events (gateway, binding, table,
      action, cache hit, pages, rows, duration); completion events carry identity and
      counters only, failure events add the error — whose message may quote a bounded
      (≤512-char) snippet of the gateway's *error* response and a pagination cursor for
      diagnosability, per the design's "no tokens / credentials / authorization headers /
      full sensitive inputs" wording — never tokens, successful-response bodies, or row
      data; client retry warns already carried operation + status
- [x] 4.5 Docs: `docs/open-connector.md` (config reference, three SQL interfaces, security
      model, caching, bounds, observability), ctx/UDTF examples inside it, README
      supported-sources entry (first time the source is actually queryable)

**Verification**: 157 open_connector tests. `open_connector_query` asserted to return the
same schema and values as `saas.ws.items`, replay from the table's cache entry with zero
new gateway requests, and push the same `min_value` filter and connection alias;
`open_connector_scan` asserted to execute exactly one POST, expose derived typed/JSON
columns, and reject unallowlisted, mutating, unclassified, and schema-indeterminate
actions before any HTTP execute; federated join of the mock pack (via the UDTF) against a
local CSV. Scan-completion events are emitted with the final batch (LIMIT-satisfied,
short-final-page exhaustion, and cache-replay scans included), since a satisfied
downstream LIMIT drops the stream without another poll; a test-only tracing capture
(`testutil::capture_events`) pins the emitted events themselves — exactly one
completion per scan (LIMIT-terminated stream dropped without a further poll, empty
scan, cache replay) with the documented field values, and exactly one WARN failure
event carrying the scan identity and error.

## Milestone 5+ — Real source packs (one PR each, per design rollout)

- [x] 5.1 GitHub pack (API-key auth, page-number pagination): repositories, issues, issue
      comments, pull requests, reviews, commits, workflow runs, releases — all 8 as stable
      table definitions (`packs/github.rs`, `perPage` 100 — Open Connector's camelCase
      action-input contract, reconciled against a live gateway). Engine additions the pack
      required, all sanctioned by the design spec: per-mapping `Fidelity` (issues
      `updated_at >=` → `since` pushes **Inexact** and DataFusion re-applies it — verified
      against a gateway that ignores `since` entirely; commits' strictly-after `since` is
      deliberately NOT mapped since a dropped boundary row is unrecoverable), RFC 3339
      rendering of timestamp filter literals, `Utf8ListFromObjectKey` for the design's
      `$.labels[*].name` / `$.assignees[*].login` flattening, a JSON-null *parent* on a
      nested path is absence → SQL NULL for nullable columns (GitHub `commit.author:
      null` / `issue.user: null`), and `SourcePackTable::fixed_inputs` pinning `state=all`
      on issues/pull_requests so `SELECT *` reads the complete collection while a pushed
      `state` predicate overrides the pin (GitHub defaults to open-only). `issues` is
      pure issues: the Open Connector action filters out the pull requests GitHub's raw
      endpoint mixes in, so the table declares no `pull_request` marker column (it could
      never be non-NULL) and a negative-space guard test
      (`issues_declares_no_pull_request_marker`) pins that absence. Redacted per-table
      fixtures (`packs/fixtures/github/`) are the build-time conversion contract
      (null-bearing, null-parent, empty-list, nested, extra-field rows, and a
      schema-mismatch page whose targeted (column, page, row, expected, found-kind)
      error the contract test asserts, per the admission gate); the action IDs,
      input keys, row paths, and HTTP protocol are reconciled against a live gateway,
      and fingerprint pins are now taken from live-captured contracts
      (`fixtures/github/contracts/`, landed alongside 5.2's pinning recipe: sync
      test, contract-serving mocks, drift-refusal e2e). The `issues` table
      paginates on the gateway's raw page length (`raw_page_size_path:
      $.pageInfo.fetched`, a `PageNumber` extension mirroring `total_pages_path`;
      upstream fix oomol-lab/open-connector#228): the OC action filters pull
      requests out after paginating, so filtered page length is not a termination
      signal — short-page termination would silently truncate on any PR-bearing
      page, and even empty-page termination fails on 100 consecutive PRs. Engine
      unit tests pin continue-on-full-raw/terminate-on-short-raw/missing-and-
      invalid-signal failures plus total/raw mutual exclusion; a pack e2e drives
      a 3-page scan whose middle page is all pull requests.
      Docs: `docs/open-connector-github.md` (per-table filter/limit behavior, authz/
      visibility incl. the pure-issues note, rate limits, freshness), README row updated.
      Verification: 27 pack tests (counted by
      `cargo test -p skardi --lib sources::providers::open_connector::packs::github`;
      203 open_connector tests total) — 8 fixture contract suites incl. empty pages
      and the schema-mismatch page, bind-time validation of all 8 contracts, the
      no-marker negative-space guard, and
      end-to-end via mock gateway: 150-row two-page scan with the `state=all` pin on
      every request, pushed `state` override (Inexact — faithful only inside the
      provider's enum domain), Inexact `since` narrowing + local re-filter keeping the
      boundary row, LIMIT stopping after one page, `open_connector_query` parity — plus
      new filters/json_to_arrow engine tests. Runnable local demo (`docs/open-connector/`,
      in the db-source demo style): bundled stdlib-Python stub gateway standing in for
      the remote service the way DynamoDB Local does — speaking the gateway's real
      protocol (uniform `{success, message, data, meta}` envelope, `POST
      /v1/actions/:id`, camelCase inputs) — committed ctx + four pipelines
      (stable table with pushdown, both UDTFs, federated CSV join) — every README
      command and output executed against the real server before being written down;
      a final section documents the real-gateway path, whose protocol and action
      contracts have since been reconciled live, and fingerprint pins have since
      landed for all eight tables (captured contracts under
      `fixtures/github/contracts/`).
- [x] 5.2 Slack pack (OAuth bot token, cursor pagination): conversations (channels), users,
      and files, per the design's Slack caveat — message/thread tables stay gated on upstream
      complete message-cursor handling and are explicitly documented as absent. The wire
      contract is Open Connector's normalized one, reconciled against a live gateway
      (v1.3.1) and the OC provider source: camelCase rows (`channelId`, `realName`, …),
      row arrays under `conversations`/`users`, top-level `nextCursor` (null at end), and
      Slack's in-band `ok:false` consumed by the executor (so the tables declare no
      `error_path`; the engine mechanism is modeled by the mock pack). Cursor pagination
      (`cursor` / `$.nextCursor`, `limit` 200) terminates ONLY on the end-of-collection
      spellings (null, empty-string, or absent cursor); a present non-string cursor
      fails as `PaginationCursorInvalid` (kind-only, never the value) instead of
      silently truncating, structural path failures propagate as themselves, and a
      non-advancing gateway fails as `PaginationLoop`; `files` uses Slack's classic
      `page`/`count` pagination
      terminated by the envelope's authoritative `paging.pages` (a `total_pages_path`
      extension to `PageNumber` — short non-final pages, legal under permission filtering,
      never truncate; missing/non-numeric totals fail loudly).
      `types: ["public_channel","private_channel"]` pinned on conversations as the schema's
      array (the `state=all` move, via the new `FixedValue::StrList`); `includeLocale`
      pinned on users so the declared `locale` column is populated; `files.user_id =` →
      `userId` pushed Inexact per the string-push rule; **no time filter is pushed** — the
      OC `list_files` contract declares no `ts_from` input and its strict schema would 400
      one, so `created` predicates run in DataFusion (the engine's per-mapping
      `ValueFormat` stays for future packs; non-timestamp mappings declare
      `ValueFormat::Verbatim`, which also refuses to push a timestamp literal in a
      guessed spelling). Engine support:
      `FieldType::TimestampSecondsUtc` (Slack's epoch-second `files.created` — the millis
      reader would silently produce 1970 dates); `files` optionally scopes to one channel
      via the `channelId` optional resource. **Fingerprints are pinned** (a pack
      first): each `expected_fingerprint` is the BLAKE3 hash of the canonicalized
      output schema captured from the live gateway into
      `packs/fixtures/slack/contracts/`; a sync test locks pin ↔ captured contract,
      every mock registration serves the captured contracts (so the pass side of the
      gate is exercised by the whole suite), and a drift e2e proves a differing
      discovered schema fails registration as `ActionContractMismatch` naming the
      table and action. The GitHub pack pins the same way. Live-verified: all
      three tables' generated inputs pass the gateway's strict
      action schemas (requests reach the credential wall, not `invalid_input`).

      **Pack format**: all built-in packs (mock, github, slack) are now
      declarative **embedded YAML assets** (`packs/*.yaml`, `include_str!`-compiled,
      parsed once at first registry access via `packs/loader.rs` and leaked into the
      engine's `&'static` shapes) — the design doc's illustrative pack format, and
      the groundwork for its deferred second tier (user-authored packs from a
      directory). The contract boundary is unchanged: packs stay inside the binary,
      versioned, fingerprint-gated, never user-editable. Parsing is strict
      (`deny_unknown_fields` end to end), table order is deterministic (BTreeMap),
      the loader cross-validates each document (duplicate columns, filters
      referencing undeclared columns, resource/fixed-input/pagination key
      collisions) before converting it, and a malformed asset surfaces as a
      targeted `SourcePackAssetInvalid` registration/UDTF-setup diagnostic —
      never a panic — with a parse-all test keeping shipped assets valid.

      **Verification**: 246 open_connector tests (counted by `cargo test -p skardi --lib
      sources::providers::open_connector`): per-table fixture contract tests against the
      normalized shapes (explicit nulls vs omitted `memberCount`, flattened profiles,
      deleted users, Slack's empty-string convention, epoch-seconds `files.created`, empty
      pages, and a schema-mismatch page whose targeted (column, page, row, expected,
      found-kind) error the contract test asserts, per the admission gate — distinct
      from the legitimate omitted-`memberCount` NULL path); e2e via mock gateway
      speaking the real envelope — multi-page cursor scan (no
      cursor on page 1, token afterwards, `limit` hint + `types` array pin on every
      request), both termination spellings, pagination-loop detection bounded at the first
      repeated cursor, LIMIT early stop, empty workspace, `userId` pushed and re-applied
      against an ignoring provider, the negative-space guard that no time key ever reaches
      the wire, gateway-failure surfacing of Slack's `ok:false`, multi-table binding with
      zero required resources, UDTF parity for `slack.users`, and a two-page
      users cursor scan pinning that table's own wire declarations (`$.users`
      row path, `cursor`/`limit` inputs) independently of conversations'.
- [x] 5.3 Notion pack (integration token, cursor pagination): `users`, `pages`,
      `data_sources`, `block_children` as stable tables (`packs/notion.yaml`).
      The wire contract is Open Connector's raw passthrough of the Notion API
      (rows verbatim under `$.results`, native `$.next_cursor` envelope — null
      terminates, `has_more` deliberately unused; camelCase strict inputs
      `startCursor`/`pageSize`/`blockId`), reconciled against a live gateway.
      `pages`/`data_sources` are two pinned views of `notion.search`: the
      required `query` pinned to `""` plus per-table object `filter` pins —
      which required the one engine extension this milestone adds,
      **`FixedValue::Json`** (object-shaped fixed inputs, loader-parsed and
      leaked, with the non-finite-float guard extended to nested values).
      **No filter pushdown anywhere** (search's free-text relevance `query`
      maps to no SQL predicate faithfully; the other actions declare no filter
      inputs) — a wire guard test pins that requests carry exactly the declared
      inputs. Dynamic property maps stay opaque JSON: the `rows` table over
      `query_data_source` is deliberately absent pending the design's
      binding-time schema freeze, and `block_children` excludes the
      type-keyed payload (a fixed mapping cannot address a key named BY
      `type`). `users` excludes `person.email` (capability-gated, privacy).
      Fingerprints pinned from live capture (`fixtures/notion/contracts/`;
      pages/data_sources share search's pin); the coverage-gap pin records
      that search declares an EMPTY item schema, so both search tables'
      columns ride additionalProperties passthrough. Live-verified: all four
      tables register against a live gateway (pins match discovery) and every
      scan reaches the credential wall with the exact pinned wire inputs
      (`{"filter":{"property":"object","value":"page"},"query":"","pageSize":100}`
      observed in the gateway's own run log). **Verification**: 260
      open_connector tests (counted by `cargo test -p skardi --lib
      sources::providers::open_connector`; 14 new) — four fixture contract
      suites plus the schema-mismatch fixture, fingerprint sync + coverage
      pins, drift-refusal e2e, and per-declaration e2e (users two-page cursor
      with row identity, per-table search filter pins with an
      exactly-the-declared-inputs guard, blockId resource forwarding +
      pre-HTTP enforcement, LIMIT early-stop, UDTF parity).
- [x] 5.4 Feishu pack (OAuth user token, cursor pagination, hybrid wire shape — normalized envelope with raw snake_case items): chats, messages, chat_members, tasks, wiki_spaces, wiki_nodes.
      Live contract reconciliation (gateway v1.3.3; all six input sets
      validated to the credential wall, then all six tables verified against a
      REAL workspace end to end on 2026-08-04 — the loose items schemas make
      real rows the only column truth, and every fixture is a redacted live
      capture). The live pass caught three contract defects no mock could:
      tasks' `completed` boolean does not exist on the wire (status/
      completed_at do; the draft column + pushdown are gone), Feishu wiki
      answers its final page with `has_more:false` beside a NON-empty
      `page_token` (new Cursor `has_more_path` engine field, authoritative
      termination, both failure arms typed), and `im/v1/messages` caps
      page_size at 50 on the wire against a declared max of 100. Engine
      extensions: `timestamp_ms_string_utc`/`timestamp_s_string_utc` column
      types, `epoch_seconds_string` filter format, simplified-boolean pushdown
      normalization, `has_more_path`. Live e2e evidence: registration through
      LIVE discovery; 86 messages over two real cursor pages, zero duplicate
      ids; `create_time >=` pushdown narrowing a live scan to 15 rows; every
      mapped column of every table non-NULL on real rows. Verification: 285
      tests (`cargo test -p skardi --lib sources::providers::open_connector`,
      post-merge with 5.3), 17 pack-scoped (`… packs::feishu`), 842 full
      library suite.
- [ ] 5.5 Later waves per the design rollout (Google Workspace, Discord, HubSpot, Jira, …) through the source-pack admission gate

**Gate for each pack** (from the design spec): complete terminating pagination,
deterministic schema, read-only allowlist, documented authz/rate limits,
bounded safety defaults, null/empty/nested fixtures, docs.

## Review notes

- **Current PR**: milestone 5.2 (Slack pack — conversations, users, files).
  Milestones 1–4 and 5.1 (GitHub pack) are merged; this PR adds the second
  real source pack against Open Connector's normalized Slack contract
  (reconciled live), plus the engine extensions it required
  (`total_pages_path` on PageNumber, per-mapping `ValueFormat`,
  `FieldType::TimestampSecondsUtc`, `FixedValue::StrList`).
- **Invariants to hold in review**: no provider credentials in Skardi;
  read-only until explicitly designed otherwise; pure validation shared by
  CLI and server; no network I/O at query-planning time; no `.unwrap()` in
  production paths.
