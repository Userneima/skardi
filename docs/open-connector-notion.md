# Notion Source Pack

The built-in `notion` source pack exposes Notion workspace data — users,
pages, data sources, and block children — as stable SQL tables through an
[Open Connector gateway](open-connector.md). The Notion integration token
lives in Open Connector; Skardi holds only the gateway runtime token.

**The wire contract is Open Connector's raw passthrough of the Notion
API**: rows are Notion objects verbatim under `$.results`, with Notion's
native cursor envelope beside them (`$.next_cursor`, null at
end-of-collection; `has_more` is redundant and unused). Inputs are the
gateway's camelCase strict schema (`startCursor`/`pageSize`/`blockId`).
Everything below is reconciled against a live gateway **and verified end
to end against a real Notion workspace** (2026-08-03). The gateway pins
`Notion-Version: 2026-03-11`; that version is what makes the
`data_source` filter spelling valid (pre-2025-09-03 versions spell it
`database`) and what renames the page flag to `is_archived`. If the
gateway's pinned Notion version ever changes, the action-contract
fingerprints refuse registration rather than drifting silently.

## Binding

```yaml
spec:
  data_sources:
    - name: saas
      type: open_connector
      connection_string: http://open-connector:3000
      hierarchy_level: catalog
      open_connector:
        runtime_token_env: OPEN_CONNECTOR_TOKEN
        bindings:
          - name: notion_ws              # schema name in SQL
            source_pack: notion
            resource:
              blockId: <page-or-block-uuid>   # only block_children uses it
            tables: [users, pages, data_sources, block_children]
```

```sql
SELECT id, name, type FROM saas.notion_ws.users WHERE type = 'person';

-- The same definition, ad hoc, without a binding:
SELECT id, url FROM open_connector_query('saas', 'notion.pages', '{}')
WHERE NOT in_trash LIMIT 20;
```

## Tables

| Table | Action | Resources | Pagination | Filter pushdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | `notion.list_users` | — | cursor (`pageSize` 100) | none |
| `pages` | `notion.search` (pinned `query: ""`, `filter: {object: page}`) | — | cursor (`pageSize` 100) | none |
| `data_sources` | `notion.search` (pinned `filter: {object: data_source}`) | — | cursor (`pageSize` 100) | none |
| `block_children` | `notion.list_block_children` | `blockId` (required) | cursor (`pageSize` 100) | none |

**No filter pushdown anywhere** — `notion.search`'s only narrowing input
is a free-text relevance `query`, which no SQL predicate maps to
faithfully; the other actions declare no filter inputs. Every predicate
runs in DataFusion after the bounded fetch; `LIMIT` stops pagination as
soon as enough rows have been emitted. Cursor scans terminate on the
null-cursor spelling; a non-advancing gateway fails as a pagination loop.

The default safety bounds cap an unfiltered scan at 100 × 100 = 10,000
rows before it **fails** with `ScanBoundsExceeded` (fail-don't-truncate);
raise `max_pages`/`max_rows` in the `open_connector:` block or narrow with
`LIMIT` — see [the integration guide](open-connector.md#bounds-retries-and-errors).

Column references live in the pack definition
(`crates/skardi/src/sources/providers/open_connector/packs/notion.yaml`);
highlights and caveats:

- **`pages`/`data_sources` are the complete visible listing**: the
  required search `query` is pinned to `""` and the object `filter` is
  pinned per table — Notion's spelling for "everything the integration
  can see". Visibility is exactly what has been shared with the
  integration in Notion.
- **Dynamic property maps stay opaque JSON** (`properties`, `parent`):
  typed projection of user-defined schemas is the deferred
  `query_data_source` work (binding-time schema freeze per the design).
  There is deliberately **no rows table yet**.
- **`block_children` returns block metadata only** — the type-specific
  payload lives under a key named by `type`, which a fixed mapping cannot
  address; rendered content is a future markdown table.
- **`users` excludes `person.email`** and the raw `person`/`bot` objects
  (capability-gated, privacy-sensitive).
- **Deletion flags follow the real wire, not the declared contract**: on
  Notion-Version 2026-03-11 pages carry `is_archived` + `in_trash`, while
  data sources and blocks carry `in_trash` only — there is no `archived`
  field on any live object, so the pack does not map one.
- **Action-contract fingerprints are pinned** from a live capture
  (`packs/fixtures/notion/contracts/`); `pages`/`data_sources` share
  `notion.search`'s pin. Note: the gateway declares the search item
  schema as an `anyOf` (page | data_source), which the coverage walker
  does not descend, so the two search tables' columns sit outside the
  fingerprint gate entirely (pinned as such by the coverage test) — their
  drift surfaces at scan time under the conversion rules.

## Authorization and visibility

Everything is bounded by the Open Connector Notion integration's access:
pages and data sources appear only where the integration has been shared;
`users` requires the integration's user-information capability.

## Rate limits and freshness

Notion's API averages ~3 requests/second per integration; each scanned
page is one request, retried on `429` with `Retry-After` honored inside
the scan deadline. Reads are live by default; the gateway-level TTL cache
applies as documented in the [general guide](open-connector.md#caching-and-freshness).
